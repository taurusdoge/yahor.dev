# hey, it's my personal website ğŸ‘‹

Written in simple HTML, CSS, and a bit of JS. I use Vite for dev server and building because it's fast and I like it. The deployment is crude and manual but I pinky swear to add a GitHub action someday.

## run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## build it

```bash
npm run build
```

The deployment? Just drag the `dist/` folder to Netlify or wherever. Very professional, I know.
